### Education
**Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K)**  
*July 2018 - May 2022*  
Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering with a Minor in Machine Learning & Application

### Experience

#### Data Scientist at Fractal Analytics
*April 2023 - Present*  
**Data Automation and Insights, Data Science R&D Team**
- Leveraged LLM - ChatGPT 3.5 to enhance automated insights generation and recommendations, fostering Unilever‚Äôs category growth via narrative building with retailer financial and demographic data sources.
- Delivered an end-to-end Flask-based Python web app predicting consumer opinions, leveraging consumer response, formulation, and sensory data. Secured an F1 score ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 across various regions.
- Utilized Factor Analysis, PCA, and Bayesian Network to extract and comprehend 6 key drivers groups for oral care from consumer response data, resulting in a 15% boost in model accuracy.

#### Data Scientist at Fractal Analytics (Eugenie.ai)
*June 2022 - April 2023*  
**Model Development**
- Researched and customized models inspired by Graphical Neural Networks, enhancing anomaly detection and predictive maintenance precision in manufacturing operations.
- Transformed classical models into Incremental models, adapting to Concept Drift in real-time IIoT (Industrial IoT) data, achieving a 25% increase in R2 score.

**Prediction Pipeline**
- Built an AI-based digital twin for Tata Metaliks (TML) and Vedanta industries, using 120 sensor parameters that predict optimal intermittent parameters, throughputs, and emission.
- Incorporated Self Adjusting Memory (SAM) KNN and AutoML as the backbone. Implemented automatic feature selection for time series sensor data using RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) and statistical tools.

**Recommendation Pipeline**
- Spearheaded the entire process of new user‚Äôs sensor data automation by streamlining data preprocessing, feature engineering, end-to-end training, inference, and recommendation pipeline.
- Utilized Genetic algorithms such as PSO, NSGA II, and Hybrid PSO - NSGA II to drive process optimization.
- Significantly increased production of the Sintering machine by 6 Ton/h and reduced emissions by 14% on average.

#### Data Science Intern at Emplay
*July 2021 - December 2021*  
**Objective**  
Enhanced semantic search results for Question-Answering Chatbot
- Improved query contextual understanding using semantic search integration into NLP phase of the pipeline.
- Engineered E2E question-answering pipeline with Haystack, tested on Postman for NLP functionality.
- Boosted semantic search accuracy by 10-15% with weighted categorization into Title, Subtitle, Body, and Description.
